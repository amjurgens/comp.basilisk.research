This my research (and assorted other things) blog, myself being Alex Jurgens, a
PhD candidate in Physics at the University of California, Davis. My research is
complex systems, with a focus on stochastic processes generated by infinite
state hidden Markov processes. My [main
homepage](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~ajurgens/) contains relevant information and
links to my [research publications](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~ajurgens/research),
my [CV](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~ajurgens/cv2020.pdf),
[Github](https://github.com/amjurgens) and [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JVSvqGEAAAAJ&hl=en), which
should cover all the requisite academic links. 


The blog's name is thanks to the classic short story
[BLIT](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm) by David Langford, which
I can't help but recall whenever I am working with fractals, which is often.
