I"Ä<p>This my research (and assorted other things) blog, myself being Alex Jurgens, a
PhD candidate in Physics at the University of California, Davis. My research is
complex systems, with a focus on stochastic processes generated by infinite
state hidden Markov processes. My <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~ajurgens/">main
homepage</a> contains relevant information and
links to my <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~ajurgens/research">research publications</a>,
my <a href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~ajurgens/cv2020.pdf">CV</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/amjurgens">Github</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JVSvqGEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google
Scholar</a>, which
should cover all the requisite academic links.</p>

<p>The blogâ€™s name is thanks to the classic short story
<a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm">BLIT</a> by David Langford, which
I canâ€™t help but recall whenever I am working with fractals, which is often.</p>
